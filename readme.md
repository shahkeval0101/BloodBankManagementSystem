This is an interactive java blood bank management system project where we have two sections admin and user.
Admin section can see the number of blood bottles present with the system and also can add the bottles from backend.
The user section have to login and can be either donor or receiver.
Donor can add blood to the system and receiver can ask for blood bottles required of certain type and system will notify it about the blood availability.
